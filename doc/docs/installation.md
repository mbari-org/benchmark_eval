# Installation

## Setting Up The Environment

First, install Python 3.10.13

```
pyenv install 3.10.13
```

Then, create a new virtual environment to work in
```
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.13 env-name
```

Lastly, install the benchmark_eval_requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*You'll see that there is also a requirements.txt file in the repository. That was from the original TrackEval, but it's a bit outdated and doesn't have updated installations.
