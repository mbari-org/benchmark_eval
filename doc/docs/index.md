Hey there! This is elaine's documentation for creating benchmark datasets and evaluating models using HOTA :)

Link to Github: [here](https://github.com/mbari-org/benchmark_eval)

A majority of the code in this repository is the TrackEval github repo. I added a bit of code here and there and set up the directory structure to run the HOTA metric for our benchmark dataset and renamed it benchmark-eval. 

## Overview

This documentation provides instructions on how to: 

- Annotate videos using RectLabel
- Obtain ground truth files and model detection files 
- Calculate HOTA scores


## Getting Started

- Check [Installation](installation.md) on setting up your environment. 
- Look into [Usage](usage.md) on how to navigate the repository
- See [Tips](tips.md) for an explanation of the directory structure and example files.
